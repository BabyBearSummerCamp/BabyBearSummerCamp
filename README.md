# Welcome to Baby Bear Summer Camp, V:Pog's first project! 
We are a new organization at Vanderbilt University working on introducing students to all aspects of video game development, from asset design to UI/UX and working with new tech stacks.
For the Spring 2022 semester, we are creating Baby Bear Summer Camp â€“ a strategic world builder centered around creating a welcoming camp for young bears. 

## While we are still working on tasks, they are now tracked interally

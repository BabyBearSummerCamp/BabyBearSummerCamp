# Welcome to Baby Bear Summer Camp, V:Pog's first project! 
We are a new organization at Vanderbilt University working on introducing students to all aspects of video game development, from asset design to UI/UX and working with new tech stacks.

## Here is what we are currently working on
- Implementing bear needs 
- Implementing overall camp well-being metrics
